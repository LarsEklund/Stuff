Human intelligence vs artificial intelligence
  What counts as accountability in scientific publications

Good morning, todays talk is going to be about Human intelligence vs Artificial intelligence and how it relates to what counts as accountability in scientific publications.

We will start talking about Human intelligence. Human intelligence is according to Britnaica, mental quality that consists of the abilities to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate oneâ€™s environment.
The main part of that is our cognitive ability, The cognitive ability is generally located to the neocortex which can be seen as a stack of neurons which interconnect in a dynamic network.
The pattern recognition theory of the mind(PRTM), common in cognitive psychology models our memories as interconnected neuron stacks of memories that is connected to pattern recognising clusters.
these clusters help us recognise our stimuli based on previous experiences and knowledge.
Our experiences and knowledge are stored as memories, which are stored in compressed structures of linked memoriy clusters which link memories that are simillars so that we do not have to store all stimuli as 
a complete image with all details. These patterns are then recognized as the input stimuli we perceive and the experience we had. 
An other very important concept in biology is the efficiency of imperfection and in all read and write operations in biology the "copying" is imperfect has errors/variation and there for att each interaction with a memory it changes somewhat.
If we look att the modern ideas of Machine Learning and Neural networks these have been model based on PRTM and therefore simulate the though process. 
If we look at LLM each iteration of the statistical model slightly changes the text. (check LLMs) If we look at diffuse models as in image generation we start with a image that is labeled most closely to the prompt.
After which we take a image of random noise change it a little and see if it looks like what the original is, this can be seen as very close to the process the brain uses pattern recognition to interpet visual stimuli And the connection and variation over stacks of interconected neuron works in many ways the same as our cognetive patterns from prior experience, this means that or AI models today have very similar working models to biological intelegence of vertebrates. 
I will come back to this later, now considering how accountability and publishing connect we have to look at the current requirements of authorship. 
These requirements and how they relate to authorship have been excellently presented by the other presenters in this course, so I will only give a brief summary of authorship mean. 
According to Science and its publisher, AAAS, the science society, an Author fulfills these criteria.
They have a substantial contributions to conception and design or acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data or the drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content and gives final approval of the version to be published. 
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, they addS a forth, the AutHour of a publication is in agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. 
So can AI be authors well as previous speakers have said according to COPE.
No. AI tools cannot meet the requirements for authorship as they cannot take responsibility for the submitted work. 
AI as non-legal entities, they cannot assert the presence or absence of conflicts of interest nor manage copyright and license agreements. 
I would argue that although the current versions of chat-bots cannot assert presence or absences of conflicts of intrest nor manage copyright, is a matter of regulation and implementation choice rather that a limitation with the AI. 
Then this boils down to is Accountability and if the AI can be accountable.
According to Cambridge Dictionary accountability is the fact of being responsible for what you do and able to give a satisfactory reason for it, or the degree to which this happens. 
Well AI and chat-bots such as chatGPT can already today answer and rephrase their text without losing significant meaning to us and it would be possible to implement the abillity to reason for a text. 
But the AI today is not self-aware, and as self awareness is a key concept in anthropocentric views of accountability it cannot be held responsible for the content it generates. 
In the example of chatGPT the AI model operates solely based on statistical patterns in the data it was trained on and does not have the ability to comprehend the meaning or implications of the text it generates.
If it does not comprehend can it be held accountable? 
therefore today accountability lies with the user and not the machine. 
Circling back to the start if Human intelligence and AI intelligence follow similar patterns of cognition is it not reasonable to argue that given the ability of ai to find information and to interpret it today, we must also se that it can be implemented in a way where it can hold accountability in all aspects except it self-awareness. 
This concludes my talk.

Thank you for Listening I hope you are as intrigued and confused about the issue as I am.

I would like to thank the FSCI 2023 organisers for the opportunity to speak.
Francis for inviting me to participate and for all the interesting conversations you start. 
Finally I would like to thank Uppsala University, SND (Swedish National Data Service), NBIS(National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) and the RDA(Research Data Alliance) for letting me work with these interesting questions.
